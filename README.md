# CS1400-Spring2021-Java
Various samples of projects I worked on in my CS 1400 class at Cal Poly Pomona. The purpose of the class was to act as an intro to java programming. Many programs here may be incomplete, unorganized, or have errors as they may not be the final version that I submitted, these are just some files I found on my PC to show my progress from when I first began to write code. Sadly I do not have the original prompts to show the purpose of the different programs and much of this code likely has very few comments in it. I won't be updating this code as it is just to show where I started, please check more recent uploads to see newer and more organized examples of my work. Reading the text files should show the outputs and purpose of many of the programs in the coding practice and projects folders.
